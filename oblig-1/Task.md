# Part – 1
In this part of this exercise, you will implement simple linear regression to predict profits for a food truck*. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You'd like to figure out what the expected profit of a new food truck might be given only the population of the city that it would be placed in. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand. You need to start examining the ´data´ by implementing the following operations:

- Import all the required libraries (for example, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc)
- You can use pandas to load the data into a data frame (or any other tool of yor choice to load the dataset from the file).
- By visualizing the dataset, you can manually find any relationship between the data. This can be done by plotting the data points in a scatter plot.
- The first column in the dataset is “X”(independent variable) and the next column is “Y” (dependent variable)
- Split 80% of the data to the training set while 20% of the data to test set.
- Now implement simple linear regression using any library function of your choice.
- Finally plot the linear model along with the data to visually see how well it fits.

# Part – 2 
Your task is to implement KNN algorithm using Iris dataset: Target attribute class:{Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica}. ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris (Links to an external site.) ) 

To implement KNN you have to:
- Split data into a train and a test split (75% and 25% respectively).
- Implement a function that returns top K Nearest Neighbors for a given query (data point).
- Measure the quality of your prediction
