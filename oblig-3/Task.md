# K-Means Clustering
Use the ALS dataset. his casestudy examines the patterns, symmetries, associations  and  causality  in  a  rare  but  devastating  disease,  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis (ALS).  A  major  clinically  relevant  question  in  this  biomedical  study  is: What  patient phenotypes can be automatically and reliably identified and used to predict the change of the ALSFRS slope over time?

# Questions and assignments
1. Load and prepare the data.
2. Perform summary and preliminary visualization.
3. Normalize the data, and analyzethe result of normalization.
4. For k-means clustering:
    - Train a k-meansmodel on the data, select k using any of the methods described during the lectures.
    - Determine the clustering, and describe the clusters in terms of all variables used in the clustering.
5. Repeat the exercise with more and fewer clusters, and analyze if the new solutions are better than the original solution!
