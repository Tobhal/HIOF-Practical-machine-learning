This assignment will cover:

Understand usage of `MLPClassifier`

In this assignment, you will implement an Artificial Neural Network with the help of Sklearn library provided class “MLPClassifier” to classify numeric digits (0-9)

- Import all the required libraries (for example, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc)
- Use datasets.load_digits() function from Sklearn library
- See : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html
- Split 70% of the data to the training set while 30% of the data to test set
- Use the methods/functions in MLPClassifier class to classify MNIST numeral dataset
- Try with different number of hidden layers and number of nodes in each of those hidden layers
- Flip the train and test set and observe the difference in performance
- Write a short report based on your observations with respect to number of nodes and number of hidden layers and your obtained accuracy on test set
